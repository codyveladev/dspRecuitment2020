Basic HTML and CSS website with a form for Fraternity Recruitment

I created this small site with the intent of it being seen on a mobile device.

The link to the site will be attached to flyers posted around campus.

Anyone is able to use my source code and change it to fit the needs of their student org. 


I hosted it Using Netlify (live-site): https://txstdsprecruitment.netlify.app/
